# Repository Guidelines

## FIRST PRIORITY: Tests must pass before every push

- Every feature and bug fix must include appropriate automated tests.
- Before pushing any code, run `npm run verify:push` and keep fixing the implementation or tests, then rerun the command until it passes completely.
- Never bypass the pre-push hook with `--no-verify`. A failing validation must block the push.
- If the agentic stop hook reports a failed push validation, inspect the failure, fix its root cause, and retry the push. Do not end the task while the failure marker remains.
- Do not weaken, skip, or delete a test just to make validation pass. Fix the root cause.

## Git workflow: commit and push often, ship to `main`

- **Commit as soon as a coherent unit of work is done**, not only at the end of the task. Push often rather than piling up local commits — an unpushed commit is not deployed.
- **Work directly on `main` by default.** Only branch when concurrent sessions would collide on the same files, and say why.
- **Never open a PR or MR.** Push straight to `main`; every push to `main` deploys to production.
- **When a task finishes on a branch, always offer to merge it into `main` and push.** A finished branch left behind never reaches production — check with `git log --oneline main..<branch>` before concluding.
- **Verify the current branch before any commit or push** and name it if it is not `main`: parallel sessions share this checkout and may have switched it.

### Prohibited Practices

-  **No useEffect**: Use fetch in server components via services, or handle side effects via event handlers
-  **No TypeScript any or as any**: Always use strong typing (not any or as any) ; if you need custom types, reuse them via @/types/ ; never use ts ignore comments.
-  **No OOP patterns**: Avoid classes or object-oriented approaches
-  **No Bad naming**: Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and components, it has to be explicit. When dealing with map, filter, reduce, etc., use don't use abbreviations for mapped variables (no 'c' for 'case', no 'i' for 'item', etc.)
-  **No Bad comments**: Never use comments to explain the code, it has to be explicit
-  **No more than 5 props**: When a component has more than 5 props, it is a sign that it is too complex and should be refactored (or pass props as a single object).

### Required Practices

-  **Component library**: Use shadcn/ui components exclusively
-  **Generic components**: Create reusable components in `@/components/ui/` when shadcn equivalent doesn't exist
-  **Authentication**: use `const session = await getTypedSession();` (see lib/auth-helpers.ts) to check auth and redirect if needed ; check user auth in actions with `authenticatedAction` (see actions/safe-action.ts)
-  **Internationalization**: Implement `next-intl` for French/English translations
   -  Client components: `useTranslations` hook
   -  Server components: `getTranslations` function
-  **Error handling**: Translate all Zod/API errors in both languages
-  **Self-explanatory code**: Avoid unnecessary comments
-  **User feedback (Sonner)**: For mutations (server actions) that change data, trigger a `sonner` toast on success and on error when it improves UX. Use `next-intl` for toast messages.

## Architecture & Code Organization

### Project Structure

-  **Feature-based architecture**: Use feature folders for each app functionality
-  **Services layer**: Write all API/Prisma calls in `lib/services/`
-  **Component splitting**: Refactor components/pages when > 350 lines
-  **Server-first approach**: Fetch data in `page.tsx` (server-side) and prop drill to client components
-  **sub-apps**: As the app is a portal, there are multiple apps (bestof, conges, cardiolarib, etc.) ; each app has its own folder in `app/` and its own `page.tsx` and `layout.tsx` ; each app has its own `lib/` folder with its own services and utils (if logic specific to app). You need to maintain the global navbar and footer for these apps. In the prisma schema, make sure that when you add infos to user, add a column in the user table for this app, so that the user can have different infos for each app and it is easier to manage and maintain.

### Data Management

-  **Prisma types**: Always use types from `schema.prisma`
-  **Server actions**: Use `next-safe-action` for all mutations (and handle side effects (like state updates, revalidation etc.) on onSuccess and onError) 
-  **Links with locale**: Use `applicationLink(locale, path)` from `lib/application-link.ts` to build hrefs that always include the active locale. Prefer the i18n `Link`/`useRouter` from `app/i18n/navigation` and pass `applicationLink(locale, '/some/path')` when constructing manual strings.
-  **Type safety**: Strong typing required (no `any` type)
-  **Global state**: Use Zustand stores in `lib/stores/` for state shared across distant components
-  **Store structure**: Separate state and actions interfaces, use TypeScript strict typing

### React/Next.js Patterns

-  **Server components**: Default choice for data fetching and static content
-  **Client components**: Only when interactivity is required
-  **Form handling**: Use React Hook Form with Zod validation
-  **State management**: Prefer server state over client state when possible
-  **Zustand usage**:
   -  Use for global state shared between distant components
   -  Create domain-specific stores (user, theme, preferences)
   -  Use selectors to optimize re-renders: `const user = useUserStore(state => state.user)`
   -  Include devtools middleware for debugging in development

## Testing & Debugging

### UI Testing & Analysis

-  **Playwright MCP**: Primary tool for testing and debugging UI
-  **Screenshots**: Take screenshots as feedback to identify and correct issues
-  **E2E testing**: Use Playwright for comprehensive testing

## Quality Assurance

### Code Review Process

-  **Standards verification**: Ensure all guidelines are followed before commits
-  **Clean codebase**: Maintain high code quality and consistency

## Project Overview

Next.js 15 application with modern stack and strict development standards:

### Technology Stack

-  **Next.js 15.3.3** with App Router and Turbopack
-  **TypeScript** with strict mode enabled
-  **Tailwind CSS v4** for styling
-  **Better Auth** for authentication (email/password and Google OAuth)
-  **Prisma** with PostgreSQL for database
-  **React Hook Form** with Zod for form validation
-  **Playwright** for E2E testing
-  **Shadcn UI** for component library
-  **Next-safe-action** for server actions
-  **Next-intl** for internationalization (French & English)
-  **Zustand** for global state management

## Deployment (Vercel)

Full reference: **`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`**. When a production build fails, use the
`probleme-deploiement` skill.

-  **Production**: Vercel project `larib-portal` under the `stoupis-projects` account, served at `www.cardiolarib-portal.com`. Every push to `main` deploys to production.
-  **Read build failures yourself** with the Vercel CLI — never ask the user to paste logs: `vercel ls`, `vercel inspect <url> --logs`, `vercel logs <url>` for runtime errors.
-  **Never use the claude.ai Vercel MCP tools**: that connector is authenticated as the previous developer and cannot see this project. Always the CLI.
-  **A green local build does not guarantee a green production build**: `next build` compiles the working tree, Vercel clones from GitHub. A source file that was never committed passes locally and fails there. `npm run check:untracked-sources` (first step of `verify:push`) guards against exactly this — never bypass it.
-  **Migrations run against production during the build** (`postinstall` → `prisma migrate deploy`). Never improvise a migration right before a push, and never run `prisma migrate reset`.

---

**Development Principle**: Write clean, type-safe, maintainable code that follows modern React/Next.js patterns while adhering to strict architectural guidelines.
